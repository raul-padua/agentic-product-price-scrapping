    "# Agentic RAG over Thousands of Tables (MELI) — Storytelling Design Doc\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Goal**: Enable analysts and product teams to ask questions in natural language (ES/PT/EN) and receive fast, governed, and trustworthy answers generated from **thousands of tables** across MELI’s data mesh. The system uses a **planner/orchestrator** and a **multi‑agent skill graph** that safely produces **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)‑first SQL** and explains lineage, caveats, and cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Problem**: Finding the right tables, joins, and trusted metrics across a large data mesh takes hours and requires deep tribal knowledge.  \n",
    "- **Solution**: An **agentic, orchestrated RAG‑to‑SQL system** that:  \n",
    "  1) discovers relevant schemas and join paths,  \n",
    "  2) drafts and validates SQL via AST + `EXPLAIN`,  \n",
    "  3) enforces governance (RBAC/ABAC, PII masking, deny lists), and  \n",
    "  4) returns **answers + charts + SQL + lineage** with consistent SLOs.  \n",
    "- **Outcomes**: 10× faster time‑to‑insight, reduced rework, governed access by default, unit economics within budget, and complete auditability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2) Problem definition - Why now?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data volume, teams, and use cases have outpaced traditional BI/SQL assistant patterns.  \n",
    "- Analysts increasingly **code‑switch** (ES/PT/EN), require **long‑context** retrieval, and need **safe defaults** (time filters, limits).  \n",
    "- With a central **orchestrator**, we can evolve from a single “SQL assistant” into a **federation of specialist agents** per domain (Ads, Payments, Logistics…).\n",

    "**Step‑by‑step (0–9):**  \n",
    "0) **User → Orchestrator**: NL question (ES/PT/EN).  \n",
    "1) **Orchestrator → Schema Searcher**: `RetrieveCandidates` (semantic + graph retrieval).  \n",
    "2) **Schema Searcher → Orchestrator**: `CandidateSet` (domains/tables/columns, scores, join priors, glossary hits).  \n",
    "3) **Orchestrator → Join/Plan Synthesizer**: `SynthesizePlan` using CandidateSet + constraints.  \n",
    "4) **Join/Plan → Orchestrator**: `LogicalPlan` (relations, joins, filters, windows) + confidence.  \n",
    "5) *(Optional)* **Orchestrator → User**: one **clarifying question** if confidence or required keys are low.  \n",
    "6) **Orchestrator → Join/Plan**: `UpdatePlan` with user’s answer.  \n",
    "7) **Orchestrator → SQL Agent**: generate/validate **AST‑first SQL** (style, CTEs) with `EXPLAIN` + AQP.  \n",
    "8) **SQL Agent → Policy/Guardrails → Executor**: enforce RLS/CLS, masking, deny lists; dry‑run, timeouts, byte‑scan budgets, caching/materializations.  \n",
    "9) **Answer Composer → User**: **final response** → narrative + chart + SQL + lineage + caveats; observability + evaluator record all steps.\n",

    "\n",
    "1) **Planner-first**: a top‑level **orchestrator** routes, retries, and records context.  \n",
    "2) **AST‑first SQL**: use parsers (`sqlglot`/DB parser) to validate structure and enforce house style.  \n",
    "3) **Governance by default**: RBAC/ABAC, PII masking, tenancy filters, time‑window defaults, `LIMIT`s, deny lists.  \n",
    "4) **Cost controls**: `EXPLAIN` → AQP/sample → cache/materialize → full execution; byte‑scan budgets + timeouts.  \n",
    "5) **Hybrid retrieval**: vector + graph/lineage + query‑log priors; boost freshness, ownership, centrality.  \n",
    "6) **Multilingual**: ES/PT/EN embeddings and prompts; avoid code‑switching errors via tests and SFT where needed.  \n",
    "7) **LLMOps rigor**: tracing, golden sets, error taxonomy, self‑repair, and regression tests.\n",

    "## 5) Agents & Interfaces (concise)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5.1 Agent Roles\n",
    "- **Intent & Constraints**: classify task; pull RBAC/ABAC; compute query budget.  \n",
    "- **Schema Searcher**: retrieve candidate **domains/tables/columns** + join priors.  \n",
    "- **Join/Plan Synthesizer**: build **LogicalPlan**; ask ≤1 clarifier if required keys are missing.  \n",
    "- **SQL Drafting Agent**: generate **AST‑first SQL**; `EXPLAIN` cost check; switch to AQP/sample when needed.  \n",
    "- **Policy/Guardrails**: apply masking, RLS/CLS, tenancy, geo/legal; rewrite SQL if required.  \n",
    "- **Executor**: dry‑run, timeout, byte caps, cache/materializations.  \n",
    "- **Answer Composer**: answer + chart + SQL + lineage + caveats; cache by `(user, intent, SQL)`.  \n",
    "- **Observability & Evaluator**: tool traces; Exec@1/Pass@k; p50/p95; cost/query; FRR; schema‑hallucination rate.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 7) Governance, Safety & Cost\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Access**: user‑impersonation; RLS/CLS; approvals for cross‑domain joins when required.  \n",
    "- **Safety**: disallow mutating statements; enforce time bounds and `LIMIT`s by default.  \n",
    "- **Cost**: timeouts; byte‑scan budgets; AQP previews; materialized KPIs; caching of hot joins/filters.  \n",
    "- **Auditability**: complete lineage; saved SQL; tool traces; reproducible snapshots.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12) Technical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12.1 Orchestration, State, and Reliability\n",
    "- **Deterministic state machine**: Run the orchestrator as a graph/state machine with an explicit state schema `{ intent, constraints, candidate_set_id, logical_plan_version, policy_decision, budget }`. Persist idempotent step tokens to enable retries and deduplication.\n",
    "- **Budgets and step guards**: Enforce per‑request ceilings on LLM calls, tokens, and wall‑clock. Track budget consumption in state; degrade gracefully when exceeded.\n",
    "- **Event backbone**: Emit normalized events (`QueryReceived`, `CandidatesRetrieved`, `PlanSynthesized`, `PolicyDecision`, `Executed`, `AnswerComposed`) to a message bus for observability and async fan‑out (evaluation, analytics).\n",
    "- **Plan versioning**: Store `logical_plan` as dialect‑aware relational algebra JSON with `plan_version` and a `constraints_digest` to support reproducibility and cache keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12.2 Retrieval, Indices, and Ranking\n",
    "- **Hybrid retrieval upgrades**: Combine multilingual dense embeddings (e.g., mE5/LabSE) with BM25/uniCOIL; apply a cross‑encoder re‑ranker over top‑k.\n",
    "- **Code‑switch normalization**: Language ID, lemmatization, and tri‑lingual glossary synsets for ES/PT/EN prior to embedding.\n",
    "- **Join‑path discovery**: Build a weighted graph from PK/FK, query logs, lineage centrality, freshness, and ownership trust. Use constrained k‑shortest paths (e.g., Yen’s algorithm) with penalties for cross‑domain hops lacking keys and boosts for observed successful joins.\n",
    "- **Metadata sanitization**: Treat catalog text as untrusted. Strip HTML/JS, neutralize markdown links, and filter for prompt/metadata injection before LLM use.\n",
    "- **Index refresh & reproducibility**: CDC‑driven re‑index with per‑entity `schema_version`, soft‑delete handling, blue/green swaps, and request‑scoped `index_snapshot_id`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12.3 Planning and SQL Generation\n",
    "- **AST‑first enforcement**: Parse with `sqlglot` into a dialect‑aware AST; apply style transforms (CTEs, qualifiers, time filters) programmatically; re‑emit per target dialect.\n",
    "- **Structural validation**: Verify columns exist, predicates align with graph keys, partition filters are present, and window/frame specs are legal.\n",
    "- **Cost‑aware planning beyond EXPLAIN**: Pre‑cost with stats (row counts, partitions, NDV, histograms); cap fanout, push down filters, avoid Cartesian joins. If `cost > budget`, transform: tighten time windows, reduce dims, or route to semantic layer.\n",
    "- **Canonical entity resolution**: Maintain a dictionary for `user_id`, `seller_id`, `order_id` with preferred tables and cross‑domain mappings to reduce ambiguous joins.\n",
    "- **Decomposition**: Split complex workflows into multi‑query plans (materialize sub‑results) with dependency‑aware execution and partial result caching.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12.4 Governance, Safety, and Policy Execution\n",
    "- **Policy‑as‑code**: Centralize RBAC/ABAC and residency in OPA/Rego or Cedar. The policy agent outputs rewrite clauses and approval requirements.\n",
    "- **Enforce at source**: Prefer DB‑native RLS/CLS, masking, and row filters over app‑side enforcement for trust‑critical joins.\n",
    "- **Explainable decisions**: Include reasons and actionable rewrite hints; attach a `policy_decision_id` to traces and cache keys.\n",
    "- **Injection defenses**: Segment LLM context for user vs metadata; disallow tool‑invoking instructions from retrieved text; use function‑calling schemas to constrain outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12.5 Execution, Caching, and Cost Control\n",
    "- **Cache keys**: Use normalized AST + `dialect` + `policy_decision_id` + normalized time windows for result caches. Hash CTE subtrees for intermediate caches reusable across users when policy‑compliant.\n",
    "- **AQP strategy**: Apply stratified/date partition sampling or reservoir sampling on high‑cardinality dims; provide confidence intervals; use weighted sampling to handle skew. Prefer DB‑native approximate funcs or run AQP in DuckDB over columnar extracts.\n",
    "- **Materializations**: Registry of precomputed KPIs/heavy joins with freshness SLAs; track hit rate and evict by staleness/cost.\n",
    "- **Budget enforcement**: Combine EXPLAIN gating, byte‑scan caps, timeouts, and dynamic downshift (semantic layer, reduced dims) with user‑visible caveats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12.6 Observability, Evaluation, and QA\n",
    "- **Distributed tracing**: OpenTelemetry spans per agent step with attributes: model, tokens, latency, cache hit, `index_snapshot_id`, `plan_version`, `policy_decision_id`.\n",
    "- **Metrics**: Per‑domain Exec@1/Pass@k, groundedness, schema‑hallucination, p50/p95 latency, cost/query, FRR exported to Prometheus and reviewed weekly.\n",
    "- **Golden sets & replay**: Curate by domain/language/time windows; nightly replay of gold + recent real queries; bisect failures by stage (retrieval, plan, policy, execution).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12.7 Multilingual and Glossary\n",
    "- **Tri‑lingual glossary**: Terms mapped to columns/metrics/domains; used in re‑ranking and plan validation.\n",
    "- **Embedding choice**: Single multilingual model to avoid vector space fragmentation; per‑language stopwords/synonyms.\n",
    "- **Locale normalization**: Handle ES/PT number/date formats in clarifiers and default time filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12.8 UX and Clarifiers\n",
    "- **Targeted clarifiers**: Allow up to 2 turns when confidence is low; present top disambiguations with previews (owner, freshness, row count, sample headers).\n",
    "- **Explainability**: Always show lineage, applied filters, and cost estimate; offer “why these tables?” with join path rationale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12.9 Scale, Capacity, and SLOs\n",
    "- **Concurrency control**: Token‑bucket per user/org and per‑agent queues with backpressure; degrade to smaller models or semantic layer under load.\n",
    "- **Capacity planning**: Pre‑warm embeddings/re‑rankers; shard vector indices; use FAISS/HNSW with IVF‑PQ for scale.\n",
    "- **Hot‑path optimization**: Short‑circuit metric‑store intents via normalized intent → metric templates, bypassing full LLM planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12.10 Data Quality and Contracts\n",
    "- **Contracts**: Enforce schema/data contracts on key tables; alert orchestrator on breaking changes and auto‑retrain retrieval weights.\n",
    "- **Quality signals**: Freshness, null rates, and anomaly scores feed retrieval re‑ranking and plan risk scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12.11 Concrete Near‑Term Additions\n",
    "- **Tech picks**: LangGraph for orchestration; FAISS/HNSW for vector index; `sqlglot` for AST; OPA for policy; OpenTelemetry for tracing; DuckDB for AQP.\n",
    "- **Cache normalization**: Implement normalized AST hashing; result/CTE caches with TTLs keyed by `index_snapshot_id` and policy changes.\n",
    "- **Join‑path scorer**: Weighted k‑shortest paths using query‑log features and ownership; evaluate via ablations in the harness.\n",
    "- **Prompt & schema hardening**: Metadata sanitization and context segmentation; red‑team tests for prompt/metadata injection.\n",
    "- **Evaluation harness**: Nightly replay and dashboards for Exec@1/Pass@3, cost, p95, and schema‑hallucination rate by domain/language.\n",

    "### Why we use an AST (vs. string-bashing SQL)\n",
    "For our SQL agent, “AST-first” means we build and edit the query as a tree, then render to SQL text at the end.\n",
    "* Validity: Parser guarantees syntactically correct SQL.\n",
    "* Safety: Easy to block nodes (DELETE, UPDATE) and auto-inject RLS/CLS, LIMIT, time windows.\n",
    "* Cost control: We can walk the tree to add filters before execution, then EXPLAIN the exact plan.\n",
    "* Explainability: Each node maps to the plan we show back (joins, filters, aggregates).\n",
    "* Programmatic edits: Refactors like “add country filter” or “tighten window to last 90 days” are trivial node edits.\n",
