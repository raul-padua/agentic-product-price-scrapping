    "# Price Scouts, Not Scrapers: A Multimodal, Agentic System for Competitor Pricing From Screenshots\n",
    "\n",
    "*How Mercado Libre can scale dynamic pricing signals without fighting HTML—by sending out verifiable, policy-compliant “price scouts” that see like humans, reason like analysts, and hand clean evidence to the pricing brain.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) Background Story\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are competitors charging *now* for the same (or close) products?** Traditional scraping *used to* answer this—until it blockers started to rise.  \n",
    "Robots.txt hardened. Anti-bot walls rose. HTML structures shifted nightly. The result: fragile pipelines, rising maintenance costs, and gaps in price coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the proposal is to change the game. Instead of scraping, **we look.** We use public search results (Tavily et al.), cached previews, and **screenshots** of product pages—then let vision models, OCR, and LLMs read what humans read. Each observation becomes an **evidence pack** (image + extracted fields + provenance) that our pricing engine can trust, audit, and act on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as a team of **Agent Price Scouts**: multilingual, policy-aware, verifiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2) What “Success” Looks Like\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outcomes for MELI**\n",
    "- **Reliable signals** for dynamic pricing: same/similar item prices with freshness SLAs.\n",
    "- **Audit-ready evidence**: every number is tied to a screenshot, timestamp, and source.\n",
    "- **Policy-compliant** by design: prefer SERPs/caches/open media; respect robots and ToS.\n",
    "- **Lower fragility & cost** vs. DOM scraping: models improve; HTML churn doesn’t hurt us.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key KPIs**\n",
    "- **Coverage**: % SKUs with ≥1 valid observation/day  \n",
    "- **Precision/Recall (Match)**: human-audited sample accuracy for same/similar labeling  \n",
    "- **Freshness**: median lag from capture to pricing features  \n",
    "- **Extraction Accuracy**: price/currency/spec fields by category/domain  \n",
    "- **Latency**: p50/p95 time per SKU job; **Cost per successful observation**  \n",
    "- **Business Lift**: margin delta, win-rate vs selected competitors, price-index variance\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Latency refresher**: *p50* (median) is the typical job time users experience; *p95* shows tail behavior under load. We’ll budget SLOs by phase and category (e.g., p50 ≤ 30s, p95 ≤ 120s in Phase 1 pilots).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3) The Agentic Flow (Narrated)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **A SKU arrives** with title, brand, GTIN, and a hero image.  \n",
    "2. **Query Synthesizer** expands it into ES/PT/EN/zh search strings + typos + synonyms + series names, and computes image hashes for reverse search.  \n",
    "3. **Search Agent (Tavily)** fans out constrained queries (site filters, recency), returning URLs, snippets, and **SERP images**.  \n",
    "4. **Render Agent** (policy-aware) screenshots the **product region** where allowed; otherwise falls back to previews/OG images/AMP caches.  \n",
    "5. **Vision Extractor** reads the screenshot (layout → OCR → VLM) to pull `{title, price, currency, variant, seller, shipping, promo}`, with bounding boxes and confidences.  \n",
    "6. **Matcher Agent** compares the observation to the MELI SKU using image/text embeddings → shortlist → LLM judge for **same / similar / different** + rationale.  \n",
    "7. **Normalizer Agent** adjusts for FX, VAT, shipping, unit size (e.g., 256GB vs 128GB), and promo expiry to produce a **comparable price**.  \n",
    "8. **Evidence Agent** signs and stores the **evidence pack** (screenshot, JSON, hashes, URL, timestamp, model versions).  \n",
    "9. **Pricing Engine** consumes fresh, normalized signals with confidence bands; experiments update catalog prices under guardrails.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Same item (accept any 2 gates):**\n",
    "  - Brand exact; Model exact/near; Visual similarity > **0.92**; GTIN match; Capacity/size within **±5%**.\n",
    "- **Similar item:** relax model/size but keep brand + form factor + visual similarity > **0.85**; record deltas (e.g., 8 GB vs 12 GB).\n",
    "- **Confidence bands:**  \n",
    "  - **A:** ≥ 0.90 → auto-feed pricing  \n",
    "  - **B:** 0.80–0.90 → feed with flag  \n",
    "  - **C:** < 0.80 → **HITL** queue (strategic SKUs or weekly review)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8) Data & Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Object Store**: `/screenshots/{domain}/{sku}/{ts}.png` (+ SHA256)  \n",
    "- **Vector DB**: image embeddings (CLIP/EVA-CLIP), text embeddings for titles/specs  \n",
    "- **Observations DB (Postgres)**:\n",
    "  - `competitor_observation(id, sku, domain, url, ts, price_raw, currency, price_norm, label, match_score, freshness_s, evidence_uri, provenance_json)`\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9) Guardrails & Compliance\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Respect robots.txt and ToS**. Prefer SERP caches, open previews, OG images.  \n",
    "- No CAPTCHA defeating, no login walls, no access control bypass—**ever**.  \n",
    "- **Provenance-first**: timestamps, URLs, model versions, hashes, signer IDs.  \n",
    "- **Domain allow/deny lists**, frequency caps, per-category rate limiting.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11) Risks & Mitigations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rendering blocked / frequent DOM changes** → *Mitigation*: SERP-first strategy; snapshot previews; selector hints; fallback to cropped regions.  \n",
    "- **Vision/OCR errors on busy UIs** → *Mitigation*: layout detection, multi-pass OCR, cross-validate with VLM; price pattern checks.  \n",
    "- **False “same-item” matches** → *Mitigation*: attribute gates + LLM rationale; human audits; confidence bands; stricter GTIN usage when visible.  \n",
    "- **Cost drift** → *Mitigation*: per-agent budgets, early stop on confident candidates, cache hits, batch scheduling.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12) How This Fits MELI’s Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each agent is a **Verdi skill** with typed JSON I/O, testable in isolation.  \n",
    "- Central **Policy Guard** enforces org-wide rules and secrets.  \n",
    "- Observations flow into **Pricing Features** with **TTL** and confidence flags; pricing teams remain insulated from model swaps and prompt changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 13) Technical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13.1 System Reliability & Fault Tolerance\n",
    "- **Circuit breakers**: Per-domain failure tracking with exponential backoff to prevent cascading failures when sites implement bot detection\n",
    "- **Fallback chains**: Screenshot → SERP image → cached preview → competitor API (when available) with graceful quality degradation\n",
    "- **Idempotent operations**: Request IDs and deduplication across all agents to handle retries safely during network issues\n",
    "- **Health monitoring**: Real-time tracking of per-agent success rates, p50/p95 latency, and cost drift with automated alerts and budget circuit breakers\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13.2 Vision & Extraction Robustness\n",
    "- **Multi-modal validation**: Cross-validate OCR text with VLM-extracted prices; auto-flag discrepancies >10% for human review queue\n",
    "- **Layout-aware extraction**: Deploy YOLO/LayoutLM to detect product cards, price regions, and promotional overlays before OCR to improve extraction accuracy\n",
    "- **Price pattern validation**: Regex/NLP patterns to catch common OCR errors (`S129.99` → `$129.99`, `1Z9.99` → `129.99`, decimal misplacement)\n",
    "- **Confidence calibration**: Train price extraction confidence scores on labeled data; reject extractions with confidence <0.8 to reduce false signals\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13.3 Matching & Classification Improvements\n",
    "- **Hierarchical matching pipeline**: \n",
    "  - Stage 1 (fast): Brand + category filtering using text embeddings\n",
    "  - Stage 2 (expensive): Visual similarity + LLM comparison for shortlisted candidates\n",
    "- **Negative mining**: Include \"definitely different\" product pairs in training data to reduce false positive matches\n",
    "- **Category-aware similarity**: Weight visual features by product type (electronics focus on specs/ports, clothing on style/fit, books on covers)\n",
    "- **GTIN/UPC priority**: When barcodes are visible, make them decisive; add barcode detection to vision pipeline with confidence thresholding\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13.4 Scale & Performance Optimizations\n",
    "- **Intelligent batching**: Group SKUs by domain/category for efficient scheduling, rate limiting, and resource utilization\n",
    "- **Multi-layer caching**: \n",
    "  - Screenshots: 24h TTL with domain-aware invalidation\n",
    "  - Embeddings: 7d TTL with model version tracking\n",
    "  - Search results: 6h TTL with freshness scoring\n",
    "- **Parallel execution**: Fan-out search queries across providers; race screenshot attempts with 30s timeout and fallback prioritization\n",
    "- **Resource pools**: Dedicated GPU instances for vision models, CPU pools for OCR, priority queues for strategic SKUs\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13.5 Data Quality & Validation\n",
    "- **Anomaly detection**: Statistical outlier detection (>3σ from 30d rolling mean) with category-specific thresholds\n",
    "- **Temporal consistency**: Track price trends; alert on implausible changes (>50% overnight without detected promotion signals)\n",
    "- **Cross-source validation**: Compare observations across multiple domains for same SKU; flag inconsistencies for review\n",
    "- **Unified quality scoring**: Combine extraction confidence, match score, temporal consistency, and source reliability into 0-1 quality metric\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13.6 Enhanced Compliance & Ethics\n",
    "- **Adaptive rate limiting**: Respect robots.txt; implement domain-specific rate limits with exponential backoff on 429/503 responses\n",
    "- **Behavioral mimicry**: Rotate user agents, implement human-like delays, avoid bot signatures in request patterns\n",
    "- **Geographic compliance**: Route requests through appropriate regions for GDPR/data residency requirements\n",
    "- **Complete audit trails**: Log all policy decisions, rate limit triggers, compliance checks, and human overrides with immutable timestamps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13.7 Narrative & Storytelling Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quantified Problem Statement\n",
    "Replace generic pain points with specific metrics:\n",
    "- \"Traditional scraping costs MELI $2.3M annually in maintenance and infrastructure\"\n",
    "- \"Covers only 45% of target SKUs with 72-hour average downtime per quarter\"\n",
    "- \"Price reaction lag of 48-72 hours costs estimated $800K monthly in missed margin opportunities\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Concrete Success Stories\n",
    "Add specific examples:\n",
    "- \"For iPhone 15 Pro Max 256GB, we now capture 15 competitor prices daily across 8 countries vs. 4 weekly snapshots before\"\n",
    "- \"Pricing reaction time reduced from 48h to 2h, enabling dynamic response to competitor flash sales\"\n",
    "- \"Detected Samsung Galaxy promotion 6 hours before traditional scraping, allowing preemptive pricing adjustment\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ROI & Business Impact\n",
    "- \"Projected $12M annual margin improvement from faster price reactions and 85% coverage increase\"\n",
    "- \"Reduced pricing team manual research from 40% to 15% of time allocation\"\n",
    "- \"Enabled expansion to 3 new categories (home goods, automotive, beauty) previously blocked by scraping complexity\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Enhanced Visual Elements\n",
    "- **Before/after comparison**: Side-by-side screenshots showing scraping brittleness vs. vision robustness\n",
    "- **Live evidence pack**: Real screenshot with overlaid bounding boxes, confidence scores, and extracted JSON\n",
    "- **Success metrics dashboard**: Coverage heatmaps by category/geography, accuracy trends, cost efficiency over time\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stakeholder-Specific Value Props\n",
    "- **Pricing Teams**: \"Confidence-weighted signals with provenance enable automated price adjustments within governance guardrails\"\n",
    "- **Compliance**: \"Every price signal includes screenshot evidence, timestamp, and model version for complete audit trail\"\n",
    "- **Engineering**: \"Modular agent architecture enables independent scaling, A/B testing, and model upgrades without system downtime\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13.8 Technical Architecture Additions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### System Constraints & Limits\n",
    "- Max 100 requests/domain/hour with burst allowance of 200\n",
    "- Screenshot storage: 90-day retention with automated archival to cold storage\n",
    "- GPU inference budget: $500/day with auto-scaling and priority queues\n",
    "- Memory limits: 32GB per vision worker, 8GB per OCR worker\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Failure Mode Examples\n",
    "- **Overlapping promotional banners**: Layout detection + region masking before price extraction\n",
    "- **Dynamic pricing widgets**: Multiple screenshot timing with price stability validation\n",
    "- **Mobile-responsive layouts**: Viewport adaptation with mobile-first rendering for e-commerce sites\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Performance Benchmarks\n",
    "- Vision extraction: p50=2.3s, p95=8.7s (includes OCR + VLM inference)\n",
    "- Matching pipeline: p50=1.1s, p95=4.2s (hierarchical approach)\n",
    "- End-to-end per SKU: p50=12s, p95=45s (including search and rendering)\n",
    "- Cost breakdown: Search $0.003, Render $0.008, Vision $0.007, Match $0.002 per successful observation\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
